						<h2 id="01">Look after yourself</h2>
						<p>Losing your job can be emotionally challenging—and even more so if it has happened unexpectedly.</p>
						<p>When you lose your job, it's important to look after your own mental health. You can start by expressing your feelings—you might like to talk to a friend or family member, or even get in touch with <a href="http://www.beyondblue.org.au/get-support/get-immediate-support">beyondblue</a> if you'd prefer to talk to someone you don't know personally. </p>
						<p>It's more important than ever to start or keep up 'healthy habits'. These can include:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>getting a good night's sleep</li>
						  <li>doing things that you enjoy (reading, gardening, meditating)</li>
						  <li>eating healthily and avoiding harmful levels of alcohol or drugs</li>
						  <li>exercising regularly.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Looking after your mind and body can help you feel calmer, less stressed and more confident, so that you're in a good frame of mind when you start looking at other employment options.</p>

						<h2 id="02">Getting financial help while you're unemployed</h2>
						<p>If you're unemployed, there's a range of financial assistance from the government that can help you.</p>
						<h3>Do you need emergency financial assistance?</h3>
						<p>Losing your job can be a stressful experience, and even more so if you're struggling to pay bills, cover rent, afford food or provide for your family's needs. </p>
						<p>If you urgently need help with living expenses there are charities and community organisations that can help you with:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>one-off food, transport or chemist vouchers</li>
						  <li>rent or accommodation</li>
						  <li>part-payment of electricity, gas or water bills</li>
						  <li>food parcels or clothing</li>
						  <li>budgeting or referrals to other programs.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>If you think you need emergency financial assistance, find your nearest emergency relief service today:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Contact the Department of Social Services on 1300 653 227 and ask to be put through to your local emergency relief service (local call cost only).</li>
						  <li>Take a look at the directories on the Salvation Army website, or call their national number on 13 72 58. </li>
						  <li>Check out the St Vincent de Paul website or call their office on (02) 6282 2722.</li>
						  <li>Contact your local church, community centre or community organisation and find out where emergency relief is provided in your area.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Understanding your financial situation and eligibility for help</h3>
						<h4>Budget</h4>
						<p>Getting a clear idea of your financial situation can help reduce uncertainty and work out what government assistance you might be eligible for. </p>
						<p>A good way to understand your financial situation is to create a budget.  A budget is a simple tool that helps you understand the money going in and out of your household. It can also help you prioritise your expenses and identify where you might be able to cut back on spending. </p>
						<p>It can be difficult to create a budget if you've never done one before, but it's an important tool to help you get clarity on your financial situation. </p>
						<h4>Eligibility for help</h4>
						<p>You might also be eligible for financial assistance through the government, such as the <a href="losing-your-job-c04.html">Newstart Allowance</a>.</p>
						<p>Newstart Allowance can provide financial help if you are looking for work. It can also support you while you take part in activities that will increase your chances of finding a job.</p>
						<h3>Government payments for job seekers</h3>
						<p>If you're looking for a job, you might be eligible for the government's <a href="losing-your-job-c04.html">Newstart Allowance</a>.</p>
						<p>Basic eligibility requirements include:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>aged 22 years or more but under Age Pension age</li>
						  <li>looking for paid work</li>
						  <li>being prepared to meet the activity test while you're looking for work</li>
						  <li>meeting an income and assets test.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Other financial assistance</h3>
						<p>If you're having trouble paying your bills while you're unemployed, it's important to talk to your bank, lenders and utility providers about your situation— particularly if the lender has security over your home, car or other assets. Contact them as soon as you can and tell them you're having financial difficulties and want to discuss repayment arrangements.</p>
						<p>If you can't agree on a new repayment arrangement with your credit provider and still need assistance, you can apply for a rebate or voucher to help you pay your utility bills.</p>
						<p>Remember, losing your job can be a difficult experience—preparing and sticking to a budget, finding ways to cut back on your spending and always asking for help - both financial and emotional - is crucial to your health and wellbeing.</p>
						
						<h2 id="03">Finding work</h2>
						<p>Finding work, particularly after you've lost your job, can seem like a daunting task.</p>
						<p>The key with finding work is to keep an open mind—a job that might not sound like it would suit you or your skills 'on paper' could actually be a perfect fit! </p>
						<p>A good place to start is to make a list of all your skills (personal included), for example:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>good communicator</li>
						  <li>strong writing skills</li>
						  <li>enjoys working face-to-face with people.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Now that you've got your list of skills and attributes, think about what industries or jobs your skills could be put to use.</p>
						<p><strong>For example:</strong> Ian's always been a mechanic, but after being let go from his job of 25 years, he has to find alternative employment. He starts by making a list of all his skills: good at solving problems, likes working with his hands, prefers to work individually as opposed to part of a team. He looks online and finds that a role as a school janitor might suit his skills. Although it's not an industry that he's ever thought about working in, the working conditions and skills he'll need are similar to the skills he's already got.</p>
						<h3>Government support for finding work</h3>
						<p>Finding work can be a difficult process—here's a range of government support, assistance and resources, to help make it a little easier.</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>JobSearch is a free online recruitment website funded and operated by the Australian Government. You can <a href="">search for jobs</a> and narrow down your selection by industry, state, time required and more. </li>
						  <li>The JobAccess website has plenty of information and resources on finding work. They can help you think about what to consider before looking for work, how to find a job, how to apply for a job, interview preparation and how to build a resume.</li>
						</ul>
						
						<h2 id="04">Training for a new career</h2>
						<p>Another option if you've lost your job is to re-train so you can start a brand new career in a different industry. Although it might take more time and money than simply going back to work, if you've always wanted to change industry, or you think you're finished working in a particular field, you might like to consider re-training. </p>
						<p>You don't have to attend university or even enrol in a full-time course to re-train! There are lots of flexible or part-time training options available including:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>going to university </li>
						  <li>enrolling in a course with a Technical And Further Education (TAFE) organisation  </li>
						  <li>starting an apprenticeship</li>
						  <li>trying out a short course through a secondary college near you. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>Start by doing some online research to find out what you'd like to study and at what level (for example, professionally recognised or informal education). </p>
						<p>Find a course that you're interested in by searching the <a href="">MySkills Training Directory</a>.</p>
						
						<h2 id="05">Retiring or accessing your super</h2>
						<h3>Retiring</h3>
						<p>If you've lost your job and you're over the 'preservation age', you might think about retiring instead of going back to work.</p>
						<p>Preservation age is the minimum age set by law when you can access your super. Your preservation age can range from 55 to 60 depending on how old you are. </p>
						<p>Retirement is not a decision to be taken lightly. It's important that you speak to a financial adviser to get some advice about whether you should return to work. </p>
						<h3>Accessing your super before retirement</h3>
						<p>Even though your superannuation is technically your money, if you've lost your job, it doesn't automatically mean that you can have access to it early. You're only allowed to access your super before you retire in very limited circumstances.</p>
						<p>You should also think about contacting your super fund to check that they'll let you access it before you apply.</p>
						
						<h2 id="06">Starting a business</h2>
						<p>If you've lost your job, another option you might like to consider is starting your own business.</p>
						<p>Although running a small business can seem glamourous compared to working for an employer—running a small business is about much more than working for yourself or from home. You'll need to have the necessary management skills, industry expertise, personal drive, technical and financial skills and a long-term vision to grow and succeed.</p>
						<p>Small business ownership can give you the ability to:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>choose your own hours</li>
						  <li>specialise in your industry of choice</li>
						  <li>work with preferred clients or customers</li>
						  <li>work from a remote location.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Visit the <a href="">Starting a business</a> topic on the business.gov.au website for information about business planning, licences, registrations and more.</p>
						<p>Download their handy resources the <a href="">Starting a business checklist</a> and <a href="">Business planning template</a>, to make sure you start off on the right foot. </p>
						<h3>Government assistance to start a business</h3>
						<p>The New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) provides training and start up business mentoring to help eligible unemployed people to establish and run their own business.</p>
						<p>To be eligible for the NEIS, applicants must be:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>18 years or over</li>
						  <li>registered for unemployment benefits through Centrelink</li>
						  <li>have a viable business idea</li>
						  <li>be willing to complete the course and follow-up components of the program.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Find out more about the <a href="">NEIS</a> on the business.gov.au website. </p>
						
						<h2 id="07">Special programmes</h2>
						<p>There are a number of special programmes and assistance measures that can help you get back into the workforce after you've lost your job:</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>Find out more about the NEIS if you're intending to start a business.</li>
						  <li>Jump on the Australian Apprenticeships website if you're interested in retraining as an apprentice. </li>
						  <li>Head to the Department of Human Services website to find information about the Financial Information Service – a free, confidential service that provides education and information on financial issues to all Australians. </li>
						  <li>Check out the Department of Human Services information on Social work services.</li>
						  <li>Find out more about the Remote Jobs and Communities Programme if you live in a remote community. </li>
						</ul>
